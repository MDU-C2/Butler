% read_me.tex

% Write your name below the title in the sections you have written. If you are the only author in a section, there is no need to add your name to its subsections.

% Author names in the titles are 'working titles' and should in the text be replaced by:

% <title>
% Your name
% \medskip
% <blank row>
% \noindent
% <actual content>

% Feel free to rename and add new SUBSECTIONS as you like if you think it is necessary. Ask me (Rickard Willman) if you have any questions.

% Flow chart and other images should preferably have the same style. (Not yet decided)
