In Figure \ref{fig:tpdb}, the work effort is illustrated with data from the time log. You can se tendencies within in the progress of the project by analysing the time reported by the members. The introductory period is quite apparent until around the beginning of September. The big dips, e.g. 23rd of September, is reported overtime. The 4th of November to the 11th of November illustrates the period from ordering parts to delivery. Observe the big increase of hours from the 14th of November and to the 10th of December where all the parts would arrive at the same time and most of the work that needed to be done could continue.
